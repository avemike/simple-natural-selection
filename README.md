### Ideas for expansion

- [ ] split `size` parameter into two: `render_size` and `interaction_size`.
- [ ] implement water need:
    - create `non-paintable`and durable spots aligned to border of each water field (let's say 10px spacing)
    - these spots would be water resources
- [ ] render instances with higher `coords.y` first

#### Design patterns

#### Naming

- classes: UpperCamelCase
- methods: lowerCamelCase
- variables: snake_case
